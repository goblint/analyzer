05 - moronic monkey: only analyze def_exc, desperately trying to beat TIMEOUTS
10 - basic buffoon: limit contexts via gas
20 - standard config
40 - enable cheap relationals and give widening gas
idea: start narrowing globals here
60 - go to polyhedral analysis with all primitive domains and give more gas
80 - unroll loops and arrays x16
90 - be branchset-pathsensitive with all primitive domains
95 - be base-pathsensitive with all primitive domains
