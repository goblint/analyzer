Fewer entries are emitted if locals from nested block scopes are excluded:

  $ goblint --enable witness.yaml.enabled --set witness.yaml.entry-types '["location_invariant"]' --disable witness.invariant.all-locals 08-witness-all-locals.c
  [Warning] Disabling witness.invariant.all-locals implicitly enables cil.addNestedScopeAttr.
