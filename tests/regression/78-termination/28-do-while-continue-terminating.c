Test 28: does not terminate but should terminate (test case
"28-do-while-continue-terminating.c") Reason: upjumping goto

If one has a look at the generated CIL output (attached at the bottom of this
file), one can see that the "continue" is translated in a "goto" with a
corresponding label "__Cont". This label points to the loop-exit condition.
Since the condition is part of the loop, its location is evaluated to 8-17. The
location of the goto "goto __Cont" is located in line 15. To provide soundness
for the analysis, the preprocessing detects upjumping gotos with the help of its
location. In case such a goto is detected, the program is classified as
non-terminating. Due to this inserted goto (which is a result of the
"continue"), an upjumping goto is located, which makes this program
non-terminating.

It should be noted that this issue happens when "do while"-loops and "continues"
are combined. If one combines "while"-loops and "continues", the analysis can
still classify the loop as terminating. The reason for that can be seen in the
second CIL output, where the "do while"-loop is replaced by a "while"-loop.
Instead of creating a new label, the "while-continue" label of the loop is
reused. Also, this goto statement is not specified as a goto, but as a Continue
statement. Hence, it is not analyzed for the upjumping gotos, which does not
lead to the problem as with the "do while".
