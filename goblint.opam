synopsis: "Static analysis framework for C"
description: """
Goblint is a sound static analysis framework for C programs using abstract interpretation.
It specializes in thread-modular verification of multi-threaded programs, especially regarding data races.
Goblint includes analyses for assertions, overflows, deadlocks, etc and can be extended with new analyses.
